For each CA 2 csv files are created: x_train and y_train. x_train file has a vector of rational numbers per each row. These numbers depict assessment of an object via given assessment model. Values in single column (i.e. column 1) of one file (i.e. x_train_CA1) were produced with same model. Corresponding y_train has an expected binary label (with a noise) related to a row in x_train file. In that sense y=f_CA (x).

Using provided data and performing its analysis build prediction model that based on x vector will produce y value without knowing function f_CA
